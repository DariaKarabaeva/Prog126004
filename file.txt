there
were
ninety-seven
new
york
advertising
men
in
the
hotel
and
the
way
they
were
monopolizing
the
long-distance
lines
the
girl
in
507
had
to
wait
from
noon
till
almost
two-thirty
to
get
her
call
through
she
used
the
time
though
she
read
an
article
in
a
womens
pocket-size
magazine
called
sex
is
fun-or
hell
she
washed
her
comb
and
brush
she
took
the
spot
out
of
the
skirt
of
her
beige
suit
she
moved
the
button
on
her
saks
blouse
she
tweezed
out
two
freshly
surfaced
hairs
in
her
mole
when
the
operator
finally
rang
her
room
she
was
sitting
on
the
window
seat
and
had
almost
finished
putting
lacquer
on
the
nails
of
her
left
hand
she
was
a
girl
who
for
a
ringing
phone
dropped
exactly
nothing
she
looked
as
if
her
phone
had
been
ringing
continually
ever
since
she
had
reached
puberty
with
her
little
lacquer
brush
while
the
phone
was
ringing
she
went
over
the
nail
of
her
little
finger
accentuating
the
line
of
the
moon
she
then
replaced
the
cap
on
the
bottle
of
lacquer
and
standing
up
passed
her
leftthe
wethand
back
and
forth
through
the
air
with
her
dry
hand
she
picked
up
a
congested
ashtray
from
the
window
seat
and
carried
it
with
her
over
to
the
night
table
on
which
the
phone
stood
she
sat
down
on
one
of
the
made-up
twin
beds
andit
was
the
fifth
or
sixth
ringpicked
up
the
phone
hello
she
said
keeping
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
outstretched
and
away
from
her
white
silk
dressing
gown
which
was
all
that
she
was
wearing
except
mulesher

began
to
walk
in
the
direction
of

walked
for
about
a
quarter
of
a

and
then
suddenly
broke
into
an
oblique
run
up
the
soft
part
of
the
beach
she
stopped
short
when

he
took
away

and

he
suddenly
got
to

looked
at
the
ocean

said
and
undid
the
belt
of
his
robe
he
took
off
the
robe
his
shoulders
were
white
and
narrow
and
his
trunks
were
royal
blue
he
folded
the
robe
first
lengthwise
then
in
thirds
he
unrolled
the
towel
he
had
used
over
his
eyes
spread
it
out
on
the
sand
and
then
laid
the
folded
robe
on
top
of
it
he
bent
over
picked
up
the
float
and
secured
it
under
his
right
arm
then
with
his
left
hand
he
took
sybils
hand
the
two
started
to
walk
down
to
the
ocean
i
imagine

seen
quite
a
few
bananafish
in
your
day
the
young
man
said
sybil
shook
her
head

and
a
half
sybil
stopped
walking
and
yanked
her
hand
away
from
him
she
picked
up
an
ordinary
beach
shell
and
looked
at
it
with
elaborate
interest
she
threw
it
down
whirly
wood
connecticut
she
said
and
resumed
walking
stomach
foremost
whirly
wood
connecticut
said

young
man

she
said
impatiently

in
whirly
wood
connecticut
she
ran
a
few
steps
ahead
of
him
caught
up
her
left
foot
in
her
left
hand
and
hopped
two
or
three
times
you
have
no
idea
how
clear
that
makes
everything
the
young
man
said
sybil
released
her
foot
did
you
read
little
black
sambo
she
said

very
funny

me
that
he
said
it
so
happens
i
just
finished
reading
it
last
night
he
reached
down
and
took
back
sybils
hand
what
did
you
think
of
it
he
asked
her
did
the
tigers
run
all
around
that
tree
i
thought
theyd
never
stop
i
never
saw
so
many
tigers
there
were
only
six
sybil
said

lipschutz
sybil
asked

said
the
young
man
what
i
like
particularly
about
her
is
that
she
never
does
anything
mean
to
little
dogs
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
that
little
toy
bull
that
belongs
to
that
lady
from
canada
for
instance
you
probably
wont
believe
this
but
some
little
girls
like
to
poke
that
little
dog
with
balloon
sticks
sharon
doesnt
shes
never
mean
or
unkind
thats
why
i
like
her
so
much
sybil
was
silent
i
like
to
chew
candles
she
said
finally
who
doesnt
said
the
young
man
getting
his
feet
wet
wow
its
cold
he
dropped
the
rubber
float
on
its
back
no
wait
just
a
second
sybil
waitll
we
get
out
a
little
bit
they
waded
out
till
the
water
was
up
to
sybils
waist
then
the
young
man
picked
her
up
and
laid
her
down
on
her
stomach
on
the
float
dont
you
ever
wear
a
bathing
cap
or
anything
he
asked
dont
let
go
sybil
ordered
you
hold
me
now
miss
carpenter
please

my
business
the
young
man
said
you

your
eyes
open
for
any
bananafish
this
is
a
perfect
day
for
bananafish
i
dont
see
any
sybil
said
thats
understandable
their
habits
are
very
peculiar
he
kept
pushing
the
float
the
water
was
not
quite
up
to
his
chest
they
lead
a
very
tragic
life
he
said
you
know
what
they
do
sybil
she
shook
her
head
well
they
swim
into
a
hole
where
theres
a
lot
of
bananas
theyre
very
ordinary-
looking
fish
when
they
swim
in
but
once
they
get
in
they
behave
like
pigs
why
ive
known
some
bananafish
to
swim
into
a
banana
hole
and
eat
as
many
as
seventy-eight
bananas
he
edged
the
float
and
its
passenger
a
foot
closer
to
the
horizon
naturally
after
that
theyre
so
fat
they
cant
get
out
of
the
hole
again
cant
fit
through
the
door
not
too
far
out
sybil
said
what
happens
to
them
what
happens
to
who
the
bananafish
oh
you
mean
after
they
eat
so
many
bananas
they
cant
get
out
of
the
banana
hole
yes
said
sybil
well
i
hate
to
tell
you
sybil
they
die
why
asked
sybil
well
they
get
banana
fever
its
a
terrible
disease
here
comes
a
wave
sybil
said
nervously
well
ignore
it
well
snub
it
said
the
young
man
two
snobs
he
took
sybils
ankles
in
his
hands
and
pressed
down
and
forward
the
float
nosed
over
the
top
of
the
wave
the
water
soaked
sybils
blond
hair
but
her
scream
was
full
of
pleasure
with
her
hand
when
the
float
was
level
again
she
wiped
away
a
flat
wet
band
of
hair
from
her
eyes
and
reported
i
just
saw
one
saw
what
my
love
a
bananafish
my
god
no
said
the
young
man
did
he
have
any
bananas
in
his
mouth
yes
said
sybil
six
the
young
man
suddenly
picked
up
one
of
sybils
wet
feet
which
were
drooping
over
the
end
of
the
float
and
kissed
the
arch
hey
said
the
owner
of
the
foot
turning
around
hey
yourself
were
going
in
now
you
had
enough
no
sorry
he
said
and
pushed
the
float
toward
shore
until
sybil
got
off
it
he
carried
it
the
rest
of
the
way
goodbye
said
sybil
and
ran
without
regret
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
the
young
man
put
on
his
robe
closed
the
lapels
tight
and
jammed
his
towel
into
his
pocket
he
picked
up
the
slimy
wet
cumbersome
float
and
put
it
under
his
arm
he
plodded
alone
through
the
soft
hot
sand
toward
the
hotel
on
the
sub-main
floor
of
the
hotel
which
the
management
directed
bathers
to
use
a
woman
with
zinc
salve
on
her
nose
got
into
the
elevator
with
the
young
man
i
see
youre
looking
at
my
feet
he
said
to
her
when
the
car
was
in
motion
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
woman
i
said
i
see
youre
looking
at
my
feet
i
beg
your
pardon
i
happened
to
be
looking
at
the
floor
said
the
woman
and
faced
the
doors
of
the
car
if
you
want
to
look
at
my
feet
say
so
said
the
young
man
but
dont
be
a
god-
damned
sneak
about
it
let
me
out
here
please
the
woman
said
quickly
to
the
girl
operating
the
car
the
car
doors
opened
and
the
woman
got
out
without
looking
back
i
have
two
normal
feet
and
i
cant
see
the
slightest
god-damned
reason
why
anybody
should
stare
at
them
said
the
young
man
five
please
he
took
his
room
key
out
of
his
robe
pocket
he
got
off
at
the
fifth
floor
walked
down
the
hall
and
let
himself
into
507
the
room
smelled
of
new
calfskin
luggage
and
nail-lacquer
remover
he
glanced
at
the
girl
lying
asleep
on
one
of
the
twin
beds
then
he
went
over
to
one
of
the
pieces
of
luggage
opened
it
and
from
under
a
pile
of
shorts
and
undershirts
he
took
out
an
ortgies
calibre
765
automatic
he
released
the
magazine
looked
at
it
then
reinserted
it
he
cocked
the
piece
then
he
went
over
and
sat
down
on
the
unoccupied
twin
bed
looked
at
the
girl
aimed
the
pistol
and
fired
a
bullet
through
his
right
temple
